        <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic granules</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>12 ounces shredded aged Gouda cheese (such as Frisian Farms®), divided
        </li>
        <li>4 ounces chevre (goat cheese)</li>
        <li>1 ½ ounces blue cheese (such as Maytag®), divided</li>
        <li>1 cup diced corned beef, warmed</li>
        <li>½ cup sauerkraut (such as Frank's®), warmed</li>
        <li>¼ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
        <li>6 slices rye bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, 
            stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 
            about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Whisk flour in gradually until smooth. 
            Cook and whisk continually for 2 minutes. 
            Add mustard, salt, pepper, cayenne, and garlic; stir to combine. 
            Gradually whisk in half-and-half and milk. Cook, whisking continually, until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 9 ounces Gouda cheese and stir. Add chevre and 1 ounce blue cheese and stir until smooth. Remove skillet from heat. 
            Stir cooked macaroni into cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Divide macaroni and cheese into 6 greased 6-inch cast iron skillets. Top each with corned beef, sauerkraut, 
            a drizzle of Thousand Island dressing, 
            and equal amounts of remaining Gouda and blue cheeses.</li>
        <li>Broil skillets in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Toast rye bread in a toaster and cut each slice diagonally into points. Serve rye bread with Reuben mac.</li>
